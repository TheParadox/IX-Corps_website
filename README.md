# IX-Corps_website

The repository for the IX-Corps website project.
The repository is set to private, so anyone whom wishes to participate will need to message me for the link.

Currently looking to use:
Web library: Laravel (PHP) for building the site.
Database: still debaiting between MongoDB (probably) or MySql.
