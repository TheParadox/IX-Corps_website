# IX-Corps_website

The repository for the IX-Corps website project.

The repository is set to private, so anyone whom wishes to participate will need to message me for the link.


Currently looking to use:

Web library: Laravel (PHP) for building the site.

Database: still debaiting between MongoDB (probably) or MySql.

It is possible to use google spreadsheets as well. May use it for a few small parts?
