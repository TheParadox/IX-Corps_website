# IX-Corps_website

The repository for the IX-Corps website project.

The repository is set to private, so anyone whom wishes to participate will need to message me for the link.



Currently Using:

Web library: Laravel (PHP) for building the site.

Database: MySql.

It is possible to use google spreadsheets as well. May use it for a few small parts?

Some files are obviously excluded from github (sensitive information/database credentials...) - if you have any issues let me know and we will have to sit down to figure out what needs to be added for you to use the site.
